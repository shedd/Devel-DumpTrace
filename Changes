	Fix for t/ppi/33.t failure on some systems.

0.13    2011-07-12
	Evaluate subscript arguments and provide smarter abbreviations
	    of large arrays and hashes.
	Upgrade bundled Text::Shorten to 0.04.
	Detect when implicit $_~~ is used in some given/when blocks.

0.12    2011-03-22
	Support for DUMPTRACE_PID and DUMPTRACE_TIME env var.

	Fix deferred evaluation of complex lvalues.

0.11    2011-02-25
	Support to include/exclude packages at import. This also fixes the
	    uninitialized hash warning with v<=5.8.

0.09    2011-02-16
	Defer output of statements containing function calls until after the
	    function call completes.

	    and not my $x=7 --> my $x:undef=7.
	Implemented "decorators" for C-style for loops, while/until loops,
	    if/elsif/else statements to show expressions that were implicitly

	    DUMPTRACE_xxx.
	PPI tweaks to improve displayed results.
	Made Devel::DumpTrace::PPI the default module (when PPI is available)
	    and added Devel::DumpTrace::noPPI to explicitly use non-PPI vers.
	Efficiency improvements for abbreviating large arrays and hashes.

0.06    2011-02-01
	Rename distribution from Devel-XTrace to Devel-DumpTrace.
	Release candidate.

0.05    2011-01-31
